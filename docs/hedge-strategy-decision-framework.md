**Characteristics**:
- Primary goal: Capital preservation
- Risk tolerance: Low to moderate
- Investment horizon: 5-15 years

**Recommended Hedge Strategy**:
- **Expiration**: 6-month puts
- **Strike selection**: 15% out-of-the-money

```

---

## Portfolio Size Considerations

### Small Portfolios ($50K - $250K)

**Special Considerations**:
- Transaction costs are proportionally higher
- Limited contract flexibility
- Focus on cost efficiency

**Adjustments**:
- **Prefer longer expirations**: Reduce rolling frequency
- **Higher OTM strikes**: 18-20% to reduce cost
- **Lower allocation**: 2-3% to manage absolute costs

**Minimum Viable Hedge**: $100K portfolio with 2% allocation = $2K annual budget

---

### Medium Portfolios ($250K - $1M)

**Special Considerations**:
- Good balance of flexibility and cost efficiency
- Multiple contract strategies viable
- Standard approaches work well

**Adjustments**:
- **Standard allocations**: 3-4% range
- **Flexible strike selection**: 15-18% OTM range
- **Consider hybrid strategies**: Mix of expirations

---

### Large Portfolios ($1M+)

**Special Considerations**:
- Maximum flexibility in strategy selection
- Can afford sophisticated approaches
- Transaction costs minimal impact

**Adjustments**:
- **Higher allocation possible**: Up to 5% if desired
- **Sophisticated strategies**: Dynamic hedging, hybrid approaches
- **Professional management**: Consider quarterly optimization

---

## Scenario-Based Decision Making

### Bull Market Protection

**When to use**: During extended bull runs with high valuations

**Strategy Focus**:
- **Lower allocation**: 2-3% (don't over-hedge in good times)
- **Longer expirations**: 6M for cost efficiency
- **Further OTM**: 18-20% strikes

**Rationale**: Markets can stay expensive longer than expected

---

### Bear Market Navigation

**When to use**: During market declines or high uncertainty

**Strategy Focus**:
- **Higher allocation**: 4-5% (more protection needed)
- **Shorter expirations**: 2-3M for responsiveness
- **Closer strikes**: 12-15% OTM

**Rationale**: More frequent rebalancing and adjustment needed

---

### Crisis Management

**When to use**: During active market stress or crashes

**Strategy Focus**:
- **Profit-taking rules**: Take profits at 3x, 5x, 10x returns
- **Reinvestment strategy**: Buy new protection at lower levels
- **Dynamic adjustment**: Weekly monitoring and rebalancing

**Rationale**: Hedges are paying off, need to manage winners

1. **Determine profile**: Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive
2. **Run analysis**: Use appropriate command for your profile
3. **Select strategy**: Based on tool recommendation
4. **Calculate allocation**: Determine exact dollar amounts

### Phase 2: Implementation (Week 2)

1. **Open brokerage account**: Ensure options trading enabled
2. **Place initial orders**: Buy recommended put options
3. **Set calendar reminders**: For rolling and review dates
4. **Document strategy**: Record approach for consistency

## Common Decision Points & Resolutions

### "Should I hedge now or wait for a better price?"

**Answer**: Hedge systematically, not based on timing
**Rationale**: Impossible to predict when crashes occur; insurance value comes from consistent coverage

### "My hedges have been losing money for 2 years. Should I stop?"

**Answer**: Evaluate total portfolio performance, not hedge performance alone
**Rationale**: Hedges lose money in bull markets by design; focus on crisis protection value

### "The market seems expensive. Should I increase my hedge allocation?"

**Answer**: Small increases (1-2%) acceptable, but avoid major timing bets
**Rationale**: Market timing is difficult; systematic approach beats tactical adjustments

### "We're in a crisis and my puts are up 500%. Should I sell?"

**Answer**: Follow predetermined profit-taking rules (sell 25-50% at 3-5x gains)
**Rationale**: Discipline prevents emotional mistakes during high-stress periods

---

## Advanced Strategy Variations

### Hybrid Approach (Sophisticated Investors)

**Strategy**: Combine multiple expirations
- **70% allocation**: 3M puts (core protection)
- **30% allocation**: 6M puts (cost efficiency)

**Benefits**:
- Balanced cost and responsiveness
- Reduced rolling frequency
- Diversified protection profile

### Dynamic Hedging (Active Investors)

**Strategy**: Adjust based on market conditions
- **Low VIX**: Increase allocation, longer expirations
- **High VIX**: Decrease allocation, shorter expirations
- **Crisis**: Active profit-taking and reinvestment

**Requirements**:
- Weekly monitoring capability
- Market knowledge and experience
- Discipline to follow systematic rules

### Tax-Optimized Hedging (High Net Worth)

**Strategy**: Structure for tax efficiency
- **Tax-advantaged accounts**: Hold hedges in IRAs/401ks
- **Tax loss harvesting**: Coordinate with portfolio rebalancing
- **Profit timing**: Manage short-term vs long-term gains
