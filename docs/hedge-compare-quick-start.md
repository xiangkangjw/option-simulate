## Red Flags to Avoid

### üö´ **Don't Choose Strategies With**:
- **Cost > 5% of portfolio**: Too expensive, will hurt long-term returns

- **Annual cost < 1% of portfolio**: Probably insufficient protection

### üö´ **Common Mistakes**:
- **Over-hedging**: Using more than 5% of portfolio for hedging
- **Under-hedging**: Using less than 2% (insufficient protection)
- **Market timing**: Turning hedging on/off based on market predictions
- **Profit panic**: Selling puts when they start paying off during crashes
