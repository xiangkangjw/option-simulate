1. Executive Summary
   Provide a concise summary of the tail hedging strategy and its portfolio protection purpose. What is the core protection hypothesis, and what black swan events does it address? Include:
   
   - **Primary Function**: [e.g., "Deep OTM put options for crisis protection"]
   - **Target Protection**: [e.g., "≥70% protection for market declines >30%"]
   - **Annual Cost Target**: [e.g., "3-5% of portfolio value"]
   - **Target Users**: [e.g., "Institutional portfolio managers, sophisticated investors"]

2. Portfolio Protection Problem Definition
   **Market Risk Problem**: [Describe specific tail risks being addressed - black swan events, market crashes >20%, liquidity crises]

   **Protection Hypothesis**: [e.g., "Deep OTM puts (30% OTM) provide asymmetric convexity during market dislocations with minimal drag during normal markets"]

   **User Decision Problem**: [e.g., "How to optimize strike/expiration combinations across volatility regimes for maximum cost-adjusted protection"]

   **Cost-Efficiency Question**: [e.g., "What is the optimal allocation to tail hedging for different risk budgets and investor time horizons?"]

3. Tail Hedging Theoretical Framework
   **Core Principles**: 
   - Tail risk hedging philosophy (Universa-style systematic protection)
   - Convexity exploitation during crisis events
   - Crisis alpha generation vs correlation breakdown protection

   **Mathematical Foundation**:
   
   **A. Jump-Diffusion Pricing (Merton 1976)** - Beyond Black-Scholes for tail events:
   ```
   dS/S = (μ - λκ)dt + σdW + (e^Y - 1)dq
   
   Where:
   - λ = jump intensity (jumps per year) 
   - κ = expected jump size E[e^Y - 1]
   - Y ~ Normal(μ_J, σ_J²) = jump size distribution
   - dq = Poisson process with intensity λ
   ```

   **B. Volatility Surface Modeling**:
   ```
   σ_imp(K,T) = σ_ATM(T) × [1 + β₁×(K/S - 1) + β₂×(K/S - 1)²]
   ```

   **C. Convexity & Crisis Alpha**:
   ```
   Convexity = Gamma = ∂²V/∂S²
   Crisis_Alpha = E[Return | Market_Decline < -20%] - Market_Return
   Protection_Ratio = Put_Payoff / Portfolio_Loss (Target: ≥0.7)
   ```

4. Data Requirements & CLI Integration
   **Real-time Data Sources**: 
   - Yahoo Finance API integration (primary)
   - Alpha Vantage API (premium features)
   - Options chain data specifications

   **Data Pre-processing**:
   - Options chain filtering (volume >0, OI >100, bid >$0.05)
   - Implied volatility validation (0.05 ≤ IV ≤ 2.0)
   - Missing data handling (forward-fill max 3 days)
   
   **CLI Data Flow**:
   - API → Data validation → Options pricing → Terminal display
   - Export formats: CSV with field specifications for further analysis

5. CLI Tool & Strategy Specification
   **Command Architecture**:
   - `options-sim run`: Basic tail hedging execution with portfolio allocation
   - `options-sim hedge-compare`: Multi-strategy analysis across timeframes
   - `options-sim analyze`: Options chain analysis and strike selection

   **Configuration Parameters**:
   - **Strike Selection**: 10-30% OTM (default: 15%, target: 30% Universa-style)
   - **Expiration**: 45-90 days (default: 45 days, roll at 21 days)  
   - **Allocation**: 3-5% maximum (configurable via MAX_PORTFOLIO_ALLOCATION)
   - **Underlyings**: SPY, QQQ, IWM (equal weight allocation)

   **User Workflow Design**:
   - **Basic User**: Single command execution with default parameters
   - **Advanced User**: Multi-timeframe comparison with custom parameters
   - **Institutional User**: CSV export for integration with existing systems

6. Implementation Details
   **Programming Language**: Python 3.8+

   **Core Libraries**: 
   - py-vollib (Black-Scholes pricing and Greeks)
   - yfinance (market data)
   - Rich (terminal UI)
   - Click (CLI framework)
   - Pandas/NumPy (data processing)

   **Options Pricing Engine**:
   - Black-Scholes for standard pricing
   - Jump-diffusion models for enhanced tail risk accuracy
   - Regime-adjusted Greeks based on VIX levels

   **CLI Architecture**:
   - Rich-based terminal UI with tables and progress bars
   - Configuration management with Pydantic
   - Error handling for market data failures and edge cases

7. Financial Risk & Limitations
   **Model Risk**:
   - **Black-Scholes Limitations**: Underprices tail events by 20-50%
   - **Parameter Sensitivity**: Volatility estimation error ±20-30% 
   - **Jump-Diffusion Calibration**: Historical vs implied parameter differences

   **Strategy Risk**:
   - **Theta Erosion**: 3-5% annual portfolio drag during normal markets
   - **Rolling Risk**: Timing decisions and transaction costs
   - **Liquidity Risk**: Deep OTM options, spreads widen 3-10x during crises
   - **Basis Risk**: Portfolio correlation with SPY (<0.95 hedge effectiveness)

   **Implementation Risk**:
   - **Data Provider Reliability**: API failures, stale data during market hours
   - **CLI Execution Risk**: Command parameter validation, output format errors
   - **Performance Risk**: Large options chain processing, memory constraints

   **Market Risk**:
   - **Low Volatility Regimes**: Extended periods of VIX <15, minimal tail risk
   - **Central Bank Intervention**: "Fed Put" reducing natural market corrections
   - **Market Structure Changes**: Algorithmic trading, flash crashes, circuit breakers

8. CLI Testing & Historical Validation
   **Command Testing**:
   - All CLI commands with parameter combinations
   - Error handling: Invalid symbols, expired options, market closures
   - Output format validation: Terminal display, CSV export integrity

   **Historical Crisis Analysis**: Validation against major market events
   - Black Monday 1987 (-22.6%)
   - Dot-com crash 2000-2002 (-49% peak-to-trough)
   - Financial Crisis 2008 (-57% peak-to-trough) 
   - COVID-19 crash 2020 (-34%)

   **Tail Risk Performance Metrics**:
   - **Tail Ratio**: Return during worst 5% market days / Average return
   - **Crisis Alpha**: Excess return during market declines >20%
   - **Protection Efficiency**: Protection provided / Annual cost
   - **Net Sharpe Ratio**: (Return - Hedge_Cost) / Volatility
