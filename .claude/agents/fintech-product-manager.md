2. **Workflow Analysis**: Map out complete user journeys from discovery through advanced usage
3. **Feature Prioritization**: Balance sophistication with usability, ensuring power users can access advanced features while maintaining accessibility
4. **Risk Considerations**: Address how users will interpret and act on complex financial data
